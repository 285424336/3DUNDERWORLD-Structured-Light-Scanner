3DUNDERWORLD-Structured-Light-Scanner
=====================================

[3DUNDERWORLD-SLS] High-accuracy Structured-Light Scanner

The primary objective of this project is the development of an innovative hardware and software solution for the rapid scanning and 3D reconstruction of objects. The system will address the complexities and problems associated with the data acquisition, processing and reconstruction of objects situated underwater. The development of such a system will enhance the techniques available to underwater archaeologists and exploration groups in general, since it will significantly accelerate the documentation and mapping process.
